# cloudir

Uploads all text files from the current working directory to [Cloud][1].
Due to its Markdown processing, you basically have a poor man's publishing
system. 

Currently, you have to manually enter your [Cloud][1] credentials at the top
of the script. You also need to have [PyCloudApp][2] installed. Tested on 
OS X 10.8 only.
